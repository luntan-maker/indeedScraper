5,"The Jr. C# Software Developer will write C# .Net customizations to meet project requirements for specific implementations of our eCommerce, Integration and other custom application development projects. This work is based on detailed wire frames, functional design documentation and technical approach specifications (use cases and requirements). Communicate daily with project management team internally via e-mail, on the phone and in person to update on project status (typically stand-up format or similar brief update reviews). Work with technical client team members to resolve any technical issues if necessary, (usually via Screenhero, GoToMeeting or similar WebEx style format). Follow internal processes for communicating current project progress, provide timeline estimates, and estimate work orders. Work with clients through debugging and quality assurance cycles.
A typical week will include 4-5 brief stand up meetings to confirm internal status on projects and 1-2 phone meetings with clients (typically facilitated by our PM team) to share updates and provide technical support. This role involves architecting or modifying an Enterprise C# based solution with projects for each customization of the client's project, working lightly with a MS SQL database, creating LINQ or Entity Framework data layers, setting up back-end business logic/workflows, and wiring ASP.NET code to the back-end workflows. Much of the time, this is wiring Angular logic to back-end workflows via Restful services and creating and validating those Restful services. In addition, this position requires testing of completed features, resolving client trouble tickets, and suggesting improvements to the company and processes during a weekly review meeting.
As Clarity continues to grow over the next 12-18 months, we will be leveraging Client feedback and internal best practices to continue development of a standard code base. In addition, Clarity will continue launching several new updates to our eCommerce and integration framework as well as further enhancing and releasing our business intelligence framework. We operate these product development teams in a scrum agile model for internal development and for many of our client-facing customization projects. This mix of internal and client-facing projects enables team members to grow their skill set as they take on new client challenges, and it also provides a solid framework to consistently build and improve on throughout.
